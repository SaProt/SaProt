# SaProt
Official implementation of SaProt.

## Installation
### Create a virtual environment
```
conda create -n SaProt python=3.10
conda activate SaProt
```
### Install packages
```
bash environment.sh  
``` 
 
## Prepare the SaProt model
We provide two ways to use SaProt, including through huggingface class and 
through the same way as in [esm github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm). Users can choose either one to use. 

### Huggingface model
We provide [SaProt](https://huggingface.co/Takagi-san/SaProt_650M_AF2) and 
[SaProt-PDB](https://huggingface.co/Takagi-san/SaProt_650M_PDB) for various use cases
. The following code shows how to load the model.
```
from transformers import EsmTokenizer, EsmForMaskedLM

model_path = "/your/path/to/SaProt_650M_AF2"
tokenizer = EsmTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = EsmForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(model_path)

#################### Example ####################
device = "cuda"
model.to(device)

seq = "MdEvVpQpLrVyQdYaKv"
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(seq)
print(tokens)

inputs = tokenizer(seq, return_tensors="pt")
inputs = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in inputs.items()}

outputs = model(**inputs)
print(outputs.logits.shape)

"""
['Md', 'Ev', 'Vp', 'Qp', 'Lr', 'Vy', 'Qd', 'Ya', 'Kv']
torch.Size([1, 11, 446])
"""
```

### esm model
The esm version is also stored in the same huggingface folder, named `SaProt_650M_AF2.pt`. We provide a function to load the model.
```
from utils.esm_loader import load_esm_saprot

model_path = "/your/path/to/SaProt_650M_AF2.pt"
model, alphabet = load_esm_saprot(model_path)
```

## Convert protein structure into structure-aware sequence
We provide a function to convert a protein structure into a structure-aware sequence. The function calls the 
[foldseek](https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek) 
binary file to encode the structure. You can download the binary file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B_9t3n_nlj8Y3Kpc_mMjtMdY0OPYa7Re/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the `bin` folder
. The following code shows how to use it.
```
from utils.foldseek_util import get_struc_seq
pdb_path = "example/8ac8.cif"

# Extract the "A" chain from the pdb file and encode it into a struc_seq
# pLDDT is used to mask low-confidence regions if "plddt_path" is provided
parsed_seqs = get_struc_seq("bin/foldseek", pdb_path, ["A"])["A"]
seq, foldseek_seq, combined_seq = parsed_seqs

print(f"seq: {seq}")
print(f"foldseek_seq: {foldseek_seq}")
print(f"combined_seq: {combined_seq}")
```

## Prepare dataset
We provide datasets that are used in the paper. Datasets can be downloaded from 
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11dNGqPYfLE3M-Mbh4U7IQpuHxJpuRr4g?usp=sharing).

Once downloaded, the datasets need to be decompressed and placed in the `LMDB` folder for supervised fine-tuning.

## Fine-tune SaProt
We provide a script to fine-tune SaProt on the datasets. The following code shows how to fine-tune SaProt on specific
downstream tasks. Before running the code, please make sure that the datasets are placed in the `LMDB` folder and the
huggingface version of SaProt model is placed in the `weights/PLMs` folder.
```
# Fine-tune SaProt on the Thermostability task
python scripts/training.py -c config/Thermostability/saprot.yaml

# Fine-tune ESM-2 on the Thermostability task
python scripts/training.py -c config/Thermostability/esm2.yaml
```
### Record the training process (optional)
If you want to record the training process using wandb, you could modify the config file and set `Trainer.logger = True`
and then paste your wandb API key in the config key `setting.os_environ.WANDB_API_KEY`. Other settings can be modified
flexibly for your own needs.

## Evaluate zero-shot performance
We provide a script to evaluate the zero-shot performance of models (foldseek binary file is required to be placed in
the `bin` folder):
```
# Fine-tune SaProt on the ProteinGym benchmark
python scripts/mutation_zeroshot.py -c config/ProteinGym/saprot.yaml

# Fine-tune ESM-2 on the ProteinGym benchmark
python scripts/mutation_zeroshot.py -c config/ProteinGym/esm2.yaml
```
The results will be saved in the `output/ProteinGym` folder.
